    <h2>On being the right size</h2>

    <p>
        Digitisation doesn't make everything equal, it just makes everything the same size. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Typically, we are offered more pixels per millimetre for a very tiny object than for a very large one. 
        The camera gets closer to small things, because it can. 
        Across a diverse collection, there probably isn't a consistent dots per real-world inch policy for 
        stamps, coins, printed books, paintings and tapestries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There's only so much zooming you can do. Capturing 
        <a href="http://hyper-resolution.org/view.html?pointer=0.241,0.000&i=Rijksmuseum/SK-C-5/SK-C-5_VIS_20-um_2019-12-21" target="_blank">The Night Watch</a>
        at 50 pixels per millimetre is a major undertaking. Capturing a postage stamp at this resolution 
        is regular macro photography or scanning.</p>

        <p>
        More pixels per real-world millimeter are available for the first Holbein than the second:

<p>Our web pages have spaces for images, we tend to fill them we the images we are given. Both of these Holbeins have more detail
    available than the arbitrary 800 pixel width shown here. We could try to use the pixel dimensions of the images to give some sense of
    relative scale. 
</p>

(relative pics)

<p>This scale is obviously hopelessy wrong. At least <i>The Ambassadors</i> comes out bigger than <i>Anne of Cleves</i> in this case. 
    There's no reason for this to be generally true, especially here where the two images are coming from different places.</p>

    <p>Maybe we can get a clue from the maximum level of detail we can find:</p>

    <p>Even if we know how big things are from written descriptions, they are presented using the same number of pixels on a web page.
        And if there is deep zoom, we're still using the same viewport from one item to the next. 
        Maybe you can spread your fingers or spin your mousewheel more for some images than for others, get deeper into them; only 
        context, experience and familiarity give you a clue how big something really might be. The exciting tininess of a miniature, 
        the imposing macho spread of _The Ambassadors_ - they both become pixels in an image tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is hardly a new problem. Loss of absolute scale is a tradeoff that lets more people look at art through printed
        reproductions too. 
</p>

<p>Can IIIF help? Not really. We're still sitting in front of our monitors and looking at our phones. 
    But there are two ways in which IIIF can do <i>something</i> with scale, 
    that allows two objects to be presented with an idea of their actual sizes.
</p>

<p>The first is the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/annex/services/#physical-dimensions">Physical Dimensions service</a>. 
    This is an extra piece of metadata a publisher can provide, that tells a software client what the physical scale is - 
    how many pixels in the image make up a millimeter in the real world. Software clients typically use this information to 
    show a dynamic ruler:

<p>A user interface could also use it to show an item compared to some other real world object:</p>

<p>(Waddeson Bequest example with screen shot)</p>

<p>Or, present two items together with the correct relative sizes:</p>

<p>Open Seadragon here with canvas composition</p>

<div id="openseadragon1" style="width: 800px; height: 800px;"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/openseadragon/2.4.2/openseadragon.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var viewer = OpenSeadragon({
        id: "openseadragon1",
        prefixUrl: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/openseadragon/2.4.2/images/",
        tileSources: [
            {
                tileSource: "https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2006AM5600/info.json",
                x: 0,
                y: 0,
                width: 0.1
            },
            {
                tileSource: "https://data.ng-london.org.uk/iiif/image/0UUJ-0008-0000-0000/info.json",
                x: 0.11,
                y: 0,
                width: 2
            }            
        ]
    });
</script>

<p>The other approach, which ends up at the same place as the above example, is to compose a IIIF Canvas with two images on it at the 
    correct relative sizes.</p>

    <p>Rather than giving two independent IIIF resources to the client, we could _place_ the items on a Canvas.</p>

    <p>Diagram of Canvas with the two Holbeins on it.</p>

    <p>The Canvas has been given a coordinate system (a width and a height) convenient for accomodating both of the Holbein images; 
        each of them has then been _painted_ onto the canvas at the following positions.

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>(This is included as a Canvas Panel developer story, because we would ideally like a simple component to render this 
        Canvas, with its complex composition, rather than have to work out the details on the client.)</p>
